## Critical Rules
- NEVER ask permission to launch validation agents — they are MANDATORY, launch them automatically
- ALWAYS launch implementation agents BEFORE writing non-trivial code
- The 4 validation agents (architect-reviewer, test-automator, code-reviewer, security-auditor) must run BEFORE any commit
- Record lessons in tasks/lessons.md after any correction from the user
